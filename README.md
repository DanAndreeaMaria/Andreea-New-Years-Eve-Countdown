# New Years Eve Countdown #

https://danandreeamaria.github.io/Andreea-New-Years-Eve-Countdown/

This project is the **winner** of **"Best First Time Hack"** on https://www.codedex.io/

**Team: Solo**

# What's the trick? #
This project was made with love and attention for details and its purpose was to countdown the days until 2024. I also added some snowflakes to cheer up the environment, to feel cozy and keep the holiday theme. 
It also has a cubic effect scroll and some fun New Year Resolutions at the bottom. The details that I am proud of are the favicon and the cursor pointer, because I like to create a signature on every project I create.

# Languages I used: #

I wanted to make an animated app where everything moves and it's "alive" and I made this possible with these 3 wonders:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript


# What I learned from my first Hackathon? #

* How it's like to work under pressure
* How to create ideas fast
* How to use GitHub (finally)
* To never underestimate your power!
